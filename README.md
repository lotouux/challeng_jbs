## About the Project
This project was developed as part of the **FIAP + JBS/Swift Challenge**, focusing on **Challenge 2: Gamification to Engage and Boost Results.**
Our goal is to design a digital solution that makes employees’ experience more engaging and motivating, by applying gamification concepts to drive results inside the company.

- **Login system** for individual access (currently simulated).
- **Gamification features** such as points, ranking, goals, and missions.

- Icons: **Bootstrap Icons**
